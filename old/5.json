This is even more true for the code portions of your criteria. A poorly placed typo can easily make one of your criteria invalid if testing for a specific functionality within your code. Even one singular objectively wrong criteria caused by a typo will **FAIL** your task!"

The criterion states,   `\"({[\" must have a corresponding closing \")}]\"` . There are two distinct typos here.\n\n1. The first group of brackets starts with a single quote instead of a double quote. This does not match the second set.\n2. The order of the brackets do not match the order you would find in code. The intention of the user is apparent, but our **auditors have to take what you write literally**. In this instance, as all brackets were grouped under one quote, it was taken to mean that they should close in the same order the were opened. This would be as follows: `“({[“ must have a corresponding closing “]})”`.\n\nEither of these issues alone would have invalidated this criterion, and thus the entire task, as code within a criterion must be exactly correct in order for the criterion to be valid.\n\n**<mark data-color=\"rgb(248, 231, 28)\" style=\"background-color: rgb(248, 231, 28); color: inherit\">The important takeaway:</mark> DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TASKS FOR TYPOS.

This means that there is a single defined path to get to a single defined answer. The more open ended your prompt, the more criteria you will have, and the more likelihood that you accidentally make a **CRITICAL FAILING** mistake!\n\n**Examples of prompts to avoid:**\n\n**PROMPT**: “*I've attached a screenshot of my python function. when I call it with input n=5, i get an unexpected result. can you walk through what this function will return for n=5, explaining each step of the logic and why it produces that result?”*\n\n* This user will have to include all of the steps in the logic in their rubric, as it is a direct ask of the prompt. Otherwise, they will **FAIL**!\n* The explanation ask within this prompt is also very open-ended. This increases the chances of missing a CRITICAL rubric item!\n* **BETTER PROMPT:** “*I've attached a screenshot of my python function. when I call it with input n=5, i get an unexpected result. What is the problem and how do I fix it?”*\n  * Still allows for two asks (Identify problem and identify fix) but gives more flexibility on “required” criteria. That will make your task **less likely to FAIL**!\n\n**PROMPT:** “*What unintended behavior would result if this function is called with a dictionary that includes nested lists as values? Explain exactly how and where the logic would break, and suggest a safer rewrite.”*\n\n* This user asked for multiple complex asks within one prompt. This is going to require a lengthy rubric to properly cover each item!

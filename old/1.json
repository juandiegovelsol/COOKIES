In this project, you’ll write a prompt that requires the model to use an image to give a correct answer, then evaluate how well model responses follow that prompt.  You’ll learn to identify hallucinations, write clear and complete rubric criteria, and rank responses based on accuracy, clarity, and alignment with both the prompt and image.  In this course, you will:  Learn to write an image dependent prompt grounded in the visual content  Understand how to break down a multimodal prompt and identify key asks  Spot common model errors like hallucinations, formatting mistakes, and factual inaccuracies  Write precise rubric criteria that fully address the prompt and image content  Learn how to rank model responses fairly and consistently  Avoid common pitfalls and apply best practices at every stage of the task  Let’s get started!\">\\\n[<span style=\"color: rgb(74, 144, 226); font-size: 24px\">**<u>Click here to review the project instructions.</u>**</span>](https://app.outlier.ai/en/expert/instruction/683de8cbb207547fff6e7793)"

It is used to evaluate whether a model answered the prompt effectively.  Rubrics are used to guide model training and evaluation, make reviewer scoring more consistent, and capture both required and preferred response features.  Each rubric includes four key elements. First, it defines clear, testable criteria that describe what a strong response should include. Second, it categorizes each item based on what it measures, such as visual perception, truthfulness, or instruction following. Third, it assigns a weight to indicate the importance of the item—typically rated as Crucial (5), Important (3), or Minor (1). Finally, it identifies whether the criterion is explicit, meaning it was directly stated in the prompt, or implicit, meaning it was only implied.\">"

You must follow the assigned prompt category, image type, and image count exactly. If the image count is labeled as “Single,” only one image should be uploaded regardless of how many turns you write. STEM or coding-related prompts and images should not be used unless explicitly allowed. Your first prompt must be image-dependent, meaning the image is required in order to answer correctly. If you're writing a follow-up prompt, it must build logically on a previous turn and cannot stand alone.  Step 2 is to evaluate the initial model responses. You’ll begin by reading and rating two model responses on a scale from one to five, with short justifications. Then, choose your preferred response between the two. If either response is a model failure, write a quick scratch rubric that describes what an ideal response should look like. Next, review two more responses, bringing the total to four, and select the best overall. If there is no model failure, continue evaluating until one is identified. Finally, do a preliminary ranking of all four responses and explain your reasoning.  Step 3 is to write rubric criteria. Create a full rubric that covers all key asks from the prompt. This should include clear, specific criteria with appropriate weights. Each criterion should be tagged with a category, such as Visual Perception or Truthfulness. You’ll also mark whether each item is explicit or implicit, and whether it is objective or subjective. Make sure to include formatting and hallucination-related criteria if needed. Keep your language clear and efficient, and avoid vague or redundant phrasing. Ensure that you don’t miss any critical asks.  Step 4 is to score, rank, and justify the responses. Use your rubric to score each response, marking each criterion as Yes, Partially, or No. For any unmet criteria, provide brief error descriptions and review the scores in the Rubric Evaluation Viewer. Rank all four responses from best to worst based on how well they align with the rubric. Ties are allowed. Then, write a Final Ranking Justification to explain your decisions—especially if your final ranking differs from the rubric scores. Be careful not to let tone or fluency outweigh more important issues like factual accuracy or instruction-following.\">"

This includes unrelated facts or fabricated details. Do not include hallucination criteria unless hallucinations are actually present in the response.  Unnecessary hallucination items are discouraged and can reduce rubric clarity.  If a hallucination is present, write a criterion that clearly identifies and penalizes the added or unrelated information.  Section: Why It Matters  Omitting required hallucination coverage means the model won’t be penalized appropriately.  This is considered a task fail and must be fixed before submitting.  Notes Section:  ➤ Some prompts only allow for one valid answer (e.g., logic, math).  ➤ Don’t use hallucination criteria just because only one answer is correct.  ➤ Use accuracy-based criteria instead (e.g., “The final answer must be X.”)  ➤ Hallucination criteria are unnecessary when correctness is already the focus.\">"

The slide is split into two sections. The left section has a gradient blue and purple background with a large bold heading that says, “And that’s a wrap!” followed by the message, “You’re ready to get started—practice will build your confidence.”  The right section is in a pale yellow box and reads:  “You’ve just learned the basics of the MM Rubrics Cookies project!” It lists key takeaways:  Identify and annotate hallucinations and factual errors.  Extend conversations naturally.  Evaluate responses and write a strong rubric.  Use clear, specific, and positively framed criteria.  Catch punts, disclaimers, or signs of task failure.\">"
